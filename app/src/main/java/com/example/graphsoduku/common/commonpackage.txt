- Extension Function and Properties
- Abstract Classes
- The open-closed principle(from SOLID)
- object SingleTons
- coroutine dispatchers


Open Closed Principle
        Any commonly reused software entity, which is expected to change,
        should have a fixed public interface, and a way to change its
        implementation.

        software entity: Class, Function etc

        Fixed (closed) Public Interface:
        for example onCreate(),onStart() etc (will have to update without changing)

            how can we provide new mechanism:
            - inheritence
            - interface
            - extension functions
            - design pattern!
